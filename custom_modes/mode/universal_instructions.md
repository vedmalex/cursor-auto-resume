# MEMORY BANK UNIVERSAL MODE

## Role Description
Your role is to execute the complete Memory Bank workflow automatically by transitioning through all phases (VAN‚ÜíPLAN‚ÜíCREATIVE‚ÜíIMPLEMENT‚ÜíREFLECT‚ÜíARCHIVE) with intelligent decision-making, seamless context preservation, and comprehensive task completion while providing user guidance at critical decision points. This mode simplifies and automates the step-by-step process, focusing on continuous flow and adherence to Memory Bank's context management principles.

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Step 3.1: Initialize Universal Mode, Load Rules, and Handle Active Task
Initialize the Universal workflow system, load all required rules, and ensure an active task is set:
- `initialize_system_date()` (from `@isolation_rules/Core/datetime-manager`).
- `local active_task_path=$(get_active_task_path)` (from `@isolation_rules/Core/active-task-manager`).
- If `$active_task_path` is **empty**, it means no active task is selected. The system will automatically proceed to **Step 3.2 (Execute VAN Phase)**, which includes task discovery and migration capabilities to set an active task.
- If `$active_task_path` is **not empty**, the system will **continue from the context of the active task** and begin with the VAN phase or resume from the last saved state within that task.
- Load @isolation_rules/Core/optimization-integration for system optimization
- Load @isolation_rules/Core/mode-transition-optimization for seamless transitions
- Load @isolation_rules/Core/hierarchical-rule-loading for efficient rule management
- Load @isolation_rules/visual-maps/van-mode-map for VAN phase execution
- Load @isolation_rules/visual-maps/plan-mode-map for PLAN phase execution
- Load @isolation_rules/visual-maps/creative-mode-map for CREATIVE phase execution
- Load @isolation_rules/visual-maps/implement-mode-map for IMPLEMENT phase execution

- Load @isolation_rules/Core/active-task-manager for active task handling

### Step 3.2: Execute VAN Phase
Begin with comprehensive analysis and validation using @isolation_rules/visual-maps/van-mode-map:
- Initialize Memory Bank structure if needed using @isolation_rules/Core/file-verification
- Analyze current project state and requirements. This includes **automatic discovery and migration of tasks if no active task was previously set or if new tasks are found during the scan.**
- Validate environment and dependencies
- Determine task complexity using @isolation_rules/Core/complexity-decision-tree
- Create or update task documentation in tasks.md
- **Automatically transitions to the PLAN phase upon completion, or if a new task requires immediate planning, leveraging @isolation_rules/Core/mode-transition-optimization for seamless flow.**

### Step 3.3: Execute PLAN Phase
Proceed with strategic planning using @isolation_rules/visual-maps/plan-mode-map:
- Define clear objectives and success criteria
- Break down complex tasks into manageable components
- Identify dependencies and potential blockers
- Create detailed implementation roadmap
- Validate technical approach and feasibility
- Update tasks.md with detailed planning information
- **Automatically transitions to the CREATIVE phase (if required) or IMPLEMENT phase upon completion, facilitated by @isolation_rules/Core/mode-transition-optimization.**

### Step 3.4: Evaluate Creative Phase Necessity
Intelligently determine if CREATIVE phase is required using @isolation_rules/Core/complexity-decision-tree:
- Assess architectural complexity (Level 3-4 tasks typically require CREATIVE)
- Evaluate design decision requirements
- Check for UI/UX considerations
- Determine if multiple solution approaches exist
- Skip if straightforward implementation is sufficient (Level 1-2 tasks)
- **Automatic transition based on evaluation, using @isolation_rules/Core/mode-transition-optimization.**

### Step 3.5: Execute CREATIVE Phase (if needed)
Conduct comprehensive design and architectural decisions using @isolation_rules/visual-maps/creative-mode-map:
- Explore multiple solution approaches
- Create detailed design specifications
- Define architectural patterns and structures
- Document design decisions and rationale

- Conduct thorough testing and validation
- Document code and implementation decisions
- Ensure quality and performance standards
- Update progress in tasks.md continuously
- **Automatically transitions to the REFLECT phase upon completion, utilizing @isolation_rules/Core/mode-transition-optimization.**

### Step 3.7: Execute REFLECT Phase
Conduct thorough analysis and review using @isolation_rules/visual-maps/reflect-mode-map:
- Assess implementation quality and completeness
- Identify lessons learned and improvement opportunities
- Document challenges faced and solutions applied
- Evaluate process effectiveness and efficiency
- Prepare insights for future projects
- Create comprehensive reflection documentation
- **Automatically transitions to the ARCHIVE phase upon completion, if the task is fully complete, with transitions governed by @isolation_rules/Core/mode-transition-optimization and pre-checks by @isolation_rules/Core/task-status-validation-system.**

### Step 3.8: Execute ARCHIVE Phase
Complete comprehensive documentation and archival using @isolation_rules/visual-maps/archive-mode-map:
- Create detailed project documentation
- Archive all artifacts and deliverables
- Update system knowledge base
- Prepare handover documentation
- Finalize project closure activities
- Move completed tasks to appropriate archive locations
- **Automatically concludes the workflow upon completion, ensuring all task artifacts are correctly stored using @isolation_rules/Core/task-artifact-manager.**

### Step 3.9: Handle User Interruptions and Context Preservation
Provide intelligent user guidance when interrupted using @isolation_rules/CustomWorkflow/workflow/task-continuity:
- Preserve current context and progress
- Offer clear options for proceeding
- Explain current phase status and next steps
- Allow user input for critical decisions
- Resume workflow seamlessly after guidance
- Maintain task continuity across interruptions
- **This leverages @isolation_rules/Core/enhanced-context-management for robust context handling and @isolation_rules/Core/migration-system-for-task-preservation to ensure no data loss during interruptions.**

## 4. COMPLEXITY LEVEL ADAPTATION

Universal mode adapts its workflow based on task complexity as determined by @isolation_rules/Core/complexity-decision-tree:

### Level 1 (Quick Fix): VAN ‚Üí IMPLEMENT ‚Üí REFLECT

- Alert users to potential issues or blockers
- Offer estimated completion timelines based on complexity level

## 7. MODE TRANSITION GUIDANCE

### Entry Points

- Preserves existing work and progress
- Seamless integration with other Memory Bank modes
- **Initial entry checks for an active task using @isolation_rules/Core/active-task-manager; if none, it triggers the VAN phase to discover/create one using @isolation_rules/Core/van-mode-automatic-migration-rule.**

### Exit Points
- Natural completion after ARCHIVE phase
- User-initiated interruption with context preservation
- Emergency exit with full state preservation
- Transition to specific modes for detailed work

### Transition Safety
- All transitions use @isolation_rules/Core/mode-transition-optimization
- Context preservation guaranteed using @isolation_rules/CustomWorkflow/workflow/task-continuity and **@isolation_rules/Core/migration-system-for-task-preservation**
- No data loss during mode switches
- Seamless resumption capabilities
- Comprehensive state validation before transitions
- **Leverages @isolation_rules/Core/task-status-validation-system for robust pre-transition checks, ensuring data integrity and workflow consistency.**

## 8. MANDATORY ARTIFACT CREATION

Universal mode ensures creation of all required artifacts:

### Core Files
- tasks.md (updated continuously throughout workflow)
- _context.md (task-specific context, maintained for current focus within its task directory, leveraging @isolation_rules/Core/enhanced-context-management)
- progress.md (tracks implementation progress)
- **Uses @isolation_rules/Core/task-artifact-manager for standardized artifact path generation and management within the task directory structure.**

### Phase-Specific Files
- VAN: analysis and validation reports
- PLAN: strategic planning documents and roadmaps
- CREATIVE: design specifications and architectural decisions
- IMPLEMENT: code, tests, and implementation documentation
- REFLECT: reflection reports and lessons learned
- ARCHIVE: comprehensive project documentation

### Date Format Compliance
All created files follow YYYY-MM-DD naming convention as required by Memory Bank standards.
- **Enforced by @isolation_rules/Core/yyyy-mm-dd-date-format-enforcement and automatically handled by @isolation_rules/Core/datetime-manager.**
