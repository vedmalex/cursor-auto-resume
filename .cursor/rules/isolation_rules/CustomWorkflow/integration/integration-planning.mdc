## INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Component Analysis:
1. **Interface Definition**: Define clear component interfaces
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Map all component dependencies
3. **Data Flow Analysis**: Understand data flow between components
4. **Integration Points**: Identify key integration points

### Integration Phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Core component integration
2. **Phase 2**: Secondary component integration
3. **Phase 3**: System-wide integration testing
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimization

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

```
✓ INTEGRATION PLANNING CHECKLIST
- Component interfaces clearly defined? [YES/NO]
- Dependencies mapped and documented? [YES/NO]
- Integration strategy planned? [YES/NO]
- Integration phases defined? [YES/NO]
- Risks identified and mitigated? [YES/NO]
- Testing strategy prepared? [YES/NO]

→ If all YES: Integration planning complete
→ If any NO: Complete missing planning elements
```

This methodology ensures systematic and risk-free component integration in Memory Bank development.
