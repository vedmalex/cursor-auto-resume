        similarity_score = calculate_similarity(current_context, pattern.context)
        success_rate = pattern.implementation_success_rate
        complexity_match = assess_complexity_match(current_context.complexity, pattern.complexity)

        relevance_score = (similarity_score * 0.4 +
                          success_rate * 0.4 +
                          complexity_match * 0.2)

**Similar Implementation**: ECOMMERCE-DB-2024-11-15
**Success Factors**:
- Use connection pooling from day 1
- Implement proper indexing strategy
- Set up monitoring before production

**Common Pitfalls**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plan for backup storage costs (unexpected 40% budget increase)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test connection limits under load (production issue in 3 projects)

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Set up connection pooling configuration
2. Create initial database schema with proper indexes
3. Implement backup and recovery procedures
