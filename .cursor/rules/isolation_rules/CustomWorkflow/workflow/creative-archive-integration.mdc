    for pattern in patterns:
        similarity_score = calculate_similarity(current_context, pattern.context)
        success_rate = pattern.implementation_success_rate
        complexity_match = assess_complexity_match(current_context.complexity, pattern.complexity)

        relevance_score = (similarity_score * 0.4 +
                          success_rate * 0.4 +
                          complexity_match * 0.2)

### Current Phase: Database Setup
**Similar Implementation**: ECOMMERCE-DB-2024-11-15
**Success Factors**:
- Use connection pooling from day 1
- Implement proper indexing strategy
- Set up monitoring before production

**Common Pitfalls**:
- ⚠️ Don't skip migration testing (caused 2-day delay in previous project)
- ⚠️ Plan for backup storage costs (unexpected 40% budget increase)
- ⚠️ Test connection limits under load (production issue in 3 projects)

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Set up connection pooling configuration
2. Create initial database schema with proper indexes
3. Implement backup and recovery procedures
```

  deviations:
    - decision: "Database choice"
      planned: "PostgreSQL"
      implemented: "PostgreSQL with Redis cache"
      reason: "Performance requirements exceeded expectations"
      impact: "Positive - 40% performance improvement"

  lessons_learned:
    - "Cache layer should be considered in creative phase"
    - "Performance testing earlier would have identified need"
    - "Redis expertise was available but not leveraged in planning"
