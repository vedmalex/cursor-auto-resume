# PROGRESS DOCUMENTATION RULES

> **TL;DR:** Maintain clear, actionable progress documentation that enables quick context switching and collaboration.

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING WORKFLOW

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start["Begin Task"] --> InitDoc["Initialize Progress Doc"]
    InitDoc --> Work["Work on Task"]
    Work --> Update["Update Progress"]
    Update --> Checkpoint{"Checkpoint?"}
    Checkpoint -->|"Yes"| Review["Review & Summarize"]
    Checkpoint -->|"No"| Work
    Review --> Archive["Archive Completed"]
    Archive --> Next["Next Task"]
```

## üìã PROGRESS DOCUMENTATION RULES

### Rule #24: Real-time Progress Updates
- **When**: After each significant change or every 30 minutes
- **What**: Current status, next steps, blockers
- **Where**: `progress.md` or task-specific progress file
- **Format**: Structured entries with timestamps

### Rule #25: Checkpoint Summaries
- **When**: At natural breakpoints (end of phase, day, major milestone)
- **What**: What was accomplished, what's next, lessons learned
- **Format**: Executive summary + detailed breakdown

## üìù PROGRESS ENTRY TEMPLATE

```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - [COMPONENT/FEATURE]

### Status: [IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED/BLOCKED/PAUSED]

### Accomplished:
- [Specific achievement 1]
- [Specific achievement 2]

### Current Focus:
[What you're working on right now]

### Next Steps:
1. [Immediate next action]
2. [Following action]

### Blockers:
- [Issue 1]: [Description and potential solution]

### Notes:
[Any important observations, decisions, or context]

### Time Spent: [X hours/minutes]
```

## üéØ CHECKPOINT SUMMARY TEMPLATE

```markdown
# Checkpoint Summary: [DATE/PHASE]

## Overview
**Period**: [Start] - [End]
**Focus**: [Main objective]
**Status**: [Overall status]

## Key Accomplishments
1. [Major achievement 1]
2. [Major achievement 2]
3. [Major achievement 3]

## Metrics
- **Time Spent**: [Total time]
- **Components Completed**: [X/Y]
- **Tests Passing**: [X/Y]
- **Issues Resolved**: [X]

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: [Description]
  **Solution**: [How it was resolved]

## Lessons Learned
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]

## Next Phase Plan
**Objective**: [Next phase goal]
**Priority Tasks**:
1. [High priority task]
2. [High priority task]

**Estimated Time**: [Time estimate]
```

## üìä PROGRESS METRICS

Track these key metrics:
- **Velocity**: Tasks completed per time unit
- **Quality**: Tests passing, bugs found
- **Efficiency**: Time spent vs. estimated
- **Blockers**: Number and resolution time

## üîÑ CONTEXT SWITCHING SUPPORT

When switching contexts:
1. **Save State**: Document exactly where you left off
2. **Next Action**: Write the immediate next step
3. **Context**: Note any important mental context
4. **Restore**: Use documentation to quickly resume

### Context Switch Template:
```markdown
## Context Switch: [TIMESTAMP]

### Current State:
[Exactly where you are in the task]

### Immediate Next Action:
[The very next thing to do when resuming]

### Mental Context:
[Important thoughts, approaches, or insights to remember]

### Files Modified:
- [file1.ext]: [what was changed]
- [file2.ext]: [what was changed]

### Resume Instructions:
[Step-by-step instructions to get back into flow]
```

## üìã DAILY PROGRESS SUMMARY

End each day with:
```markdown
# Daily Summary: [DATE]

## Today's Focus: [Main objective]

## Completed:
- [Achievement 1]
- [Achievement 2]

## In Progress:
- [Task 1]: [Status and next step]

## Tomorrow's Priority:
1. [Top priority task]
2. [Second priority task]

## Blockers for Tomorrow:
- [Blocker 1]: [Plan to resolve]

## Time Breakdown:
- [Component A]: [X hours]
- [Component B]: [Y hours]
- [Meetings/Admin]: [Z hours]
```

This documentation approach ensures continuity and enables effective collaboration.
