- Mode transition frequency and success rates
- Implementation time by task type
- Error rates and resolution times

**Quality Metrics**
- Code quality scores
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage percentages
- User satisfaction ratings

**Performance Metrics**
- System response times
- Resource utilization
- Throughput measurements
- Scalability indicators

## 📈 TRACKING IMPLEMENTATION

**Task-Level Tracking**
```yaml
task_metrics:
  id: "TASK-ID-2025-06-10"
  start_time: "2025-06-10T10:00:00Z"
  end_time: "2025-06-10T12:30:00Z"
  duration_minutes: 150
  complexity_level: "Level 3"
  completion_rate: 100
  quality_score: 85
  mode_transitions:
    - from: "VAN"
      to: "PLAN"
      duration: 15
    - from: "PLAN"
      to: "CREATIVE"
      duration: 45
```

**Mode-Level Tracking**
```yaml
mode_metrics:
  mode: "IMPLEMENT"
  session_count: 25
  average_duration: 120
