# DECISION RECORDING METHODOLOGY

> **TL;DR:** This rule defines comprehensive decision recording methodologies for Memory Bank development, ensuring all architectural and technical decisions are properly documented and tracked.

## üéØ DECISION RECORDING OVERVIEW

Decision recording captures the context, rationale, and consequences of important decisions made during Memory Bank development, creating a valuable knowledge base for future reference.

### Core Principles

**Comprehensive Documentation**
- Record all significant decisions
- Capture decision context and constraints
- Document alternatives considered
- Track decision outcomes and lessons learned

**Structured Format**
- Use consistent decision record templates
- Include metadata for searchability
- Link related decisions
- Maintain decision history

## üìã DECISION CATEGORIES

### 1. Architectural Decisions

**System Architecture**
- Overall system design choices
- Component interaction patterns
- Data flow architectures
- Integration strategies

**Technology Choices**

- Framework and library choices
- Tool and platform decisions
- Infrastructure selections

### 2. Design Decisions

**User Experience**
- Interface design choices
- User workflow decisions
- Interaction pattern selections
- Accessibility considerations

**Data Design**
- Data model decisions
- Storage format choices
- Schema design decisions
- Migration strategies

### 3. Process Decisions

**Development Process**
- Workflow methodology choices
- Quality assurance processes
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

**Team Process**
- Communication protocols
- Review processes
- Documentation standards
- Collaboration tools
