# CREATIVE DECISION CONTROL SYSTEM

> **TL;DR:** This rule implements user-controlled creative decision making in CREATIVE mode, presenting architectural options with analysis for user choice instead of making autonomous decisions.

## 🎨 CREATIVE DECISION OVERVIEW

The Creative Decision Control system activates in CREATIVE mode when interaction-mode is set to "MANUAL", ensuring users make final architectural and design decisions based on AI analysis and recommendations.

### Core Principles

**User-Driven Decisions**
- Present multiple viable options with analysis
- Provide clear pros/cons for each approach
- Let users make final architectural choices
- Document decision rationale and context

**Informed Choice**
- Analyze each option thoroughly
- Provide scoring and comparison matrices
- Highlight trade-offs and implications
- Offer implementation complexity estimates
