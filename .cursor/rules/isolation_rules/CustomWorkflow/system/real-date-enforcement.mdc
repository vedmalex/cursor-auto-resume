# REAL DATE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM

> **TL;DR:** Apply this rule when working with dates to enforce real date system and prevent hardcoded dates, ensuring dynamic date handling and maintaining temporal accuracy across all Memory Bank operations.

This rule enforces the use of real current dates instead of hardcoded dates like "2024-12-09".

## Core Principle
Always use actual current date from system: `date +%Y-%m-%d`

## Current Date Storage
File: `memory-bank/system/current-date.txt`
Contains: Real current date in YYYY-MM-DD format

## Hardcoded Date Detection
Search for: `2024-12-09` and replace with current date
Command: `grep -r "2024-12-09" memory-bank/`

## Replacement Process
1. Get current date: `date +%Y-%m-%d`
2. Store in current-date.txt
3. Replace all hardcoded dates
4. Validate consistency
