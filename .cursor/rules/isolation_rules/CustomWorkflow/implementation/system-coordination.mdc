# SYSTEM COORDINATION

> **TL;DR:** Coordinate system components effectively to ensure reliable integration and communication.

## ðŸ“‹ COORDINATION RULES

### Rule #45: Dependency-First Updates
- **When**: Making system changes
- **What**: Update dependencies before dependent components
- **Purpose**: Maintain system consistency

### Rule #46: Integration Point Verification
- **When**: After any system change
- **What**: Test all integration points
- **Purpose**: Ensure system-wide functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ COORDINATION PATTERNS

### Service Communication:
- Use consistent API contracts
- Implement proper error handling
- Add timeout and retry logic
- Monitor integration health

### Data Consistency:
- Coordinate database changes
- Ensure transaction boundaries
- Handle eventual consistency
- Implement conflict resolution

This ensures reliable system operation across all components.
